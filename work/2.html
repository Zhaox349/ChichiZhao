        <div class="title">Eggs by Stephen Elliot Dunn</div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            This multi-page website is dedicated to the analysis and
            appreciation of a non-linear poem: "Eggs" by Stephen Dunn. This poem
            explores the author’s relationship with eggs, from childhood
            fascination to adolescent rebellion to adulthood acceptance. I aim
            to create an engaging and interactive platform that encourages
            readers to connect with the poem on a deeper level and explore its
            themes and symbolism. I included several mini-games to allow the
            user to experience the plot by making choices. The breakdown of the
            poem into different sections will help guide the storyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            I envision my website as a journey through a playful and whimsical
            garden. Each mini-game and illustration serves as a colorful flower,
            inviting visitors to explore the depths of the poem's themes while
            basking in a cheerful atmosphere. Audiences will be encouraged to
            confront their own emotions and experiences, reflecting on their own
            journey of self-discovery and growth. The poem "Egg" touches on
            themes of vulnerability and the human experience, which can be
            challenging to confront. The color palette and design aesthetic will
            be extracted from eggs. Through the website's form and design, I aim
            to communicate my passion for poetry and art, showcasing my
            understanding and creative vision.

              The first game aims to highlight the word “Sunny-side-up” from the
              poem. It is considered a mature choice by his father. When user
              click on the word, an animation of breaking an egg will show up.
              Then, you will follow the hint to press the space bar and start
              the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user have to keep tapping their space bar til the egg reaches
              the fire, or the loading bar will reset to zero. Once the loading
              bar is filled up and the egg reaches to the end, the game is
              success and will automatically jump to the next page.

              The second game is linked to the choice of “Unbroken Eggs” from
              the poem. It is considered as an immature choice by the kid. When
              the user hold the left key, the bar indicates the strength of
              tossing the egg. The higher power, the higher range.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the egg meets the highest point, it will drop down. The user
              have to move the hand around and catch the egg. If you fails to
              hold the egg back to hand again, the game will continue. If you
              success, it will automatically jump to the next page.

            The last game is describing the scene when author loves to stole
            eggs from the farm on Halloween, and then throw at girls. It is the
            last action he did before becoming an adult. I imitate the process
            and turn it into a target game.

            The user have to move the cursor and shoot the moving target. keep tapping their space bar til the egg reaches
